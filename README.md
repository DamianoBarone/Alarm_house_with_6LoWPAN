# Alarm_house_with_6LoWPAN
alarm system with  Servlet, CoAP, Contiki, telegram api.
We have implemented a house alarm system with a sensor network. We have used the library of Contiki and Californium. We also have implemented a Servlet with Tomcat server for web interface with the house owner. Through the web page the owner can monitoring the battery of sensors and activate/deactivate the alarm. If the system detect a intruder sends a message through a bot of telegram in the smart phone of the owner.
